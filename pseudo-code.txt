-When the generate password button is pressed, a series of prompts needs to appear.
-The prompt needs to ask which criteria the user wants to include:
-(length of password, and whether to include uppercase, lowercase, and/or special characters)
-The uppercase, lowercase, and special characters should be accessed in an array
-Each prompt needs to store the input in a variable
-There needs to be a validation to prevent the user from not selecting any criteria
-At the end of the prompts, a random number generator needs to run over each array and output a password the length selected.
-The password then needs to be returned and output in the password form field

-Will need a varaible for: password length, lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special characters, 
-Will need a random number generator to iterate the number of times stored in the password length variable
-Function to generate the password is called generatePassword();
-The generatePassword() function will return the password to the password variable
